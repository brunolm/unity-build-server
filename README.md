This project is a simple Express server for serving static files, with special handling for `.br` (Brotli-compressed) and `.wasm` (WebAssembly) files generated by Unity WebGL builds.

## Features

- Serves all files in the project directory as static assets.
- Handles Brotli-compressed files (`.br`), setting the correct `Content-Encoding` header.
- Sets the correct MIME type for `.wasm.br` files (`application/wasm`).
- CORS enabled for all origins and methods.

## Env

- **PORT**: Default 3001.

## Usage

Go to the build directory:

```powershell
npx @brunolm/unity-build-server
```

Open http://localhost:3001/
